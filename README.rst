Pygithub3
==========

Pygithub3 is a wrapper to the `Github API v3 <http://developer.github.com/v3/>`_,
written in Python.

It has been developed with extensibility in mind, because the ``API`` is in a
beta state, trying to achieve a very loosly coupled software.

It should be very easy to extend to support new ``requests`` and ``resources``,
because each of them are managed by itself.

Fast install
-------------
::

    pip install pygithub3

Fast example
-------------
::

    from pygithub3.github import Github

    gh = Github()
    copitux = gh.users.get('copitux')
    copitux_followers = gh.users.followers.list('copitux')
    copitux_followers.all()  # lazy iterator that must be consumed

    gh.users.set_credentials(login='github_user', password='github_password')
    # or: gh.users.set_token('token_code')
    github_user = gh.users.get()
    gh.users.followers.set_credentials(login='another_user', password='another_password')
    another_user_followers = gh.users.followers.list().all()
    """ Continue...
    gh.users.emails.set_credentials( ...
    github_user_emails = gh.users.emails.list()

    Each service (users, emails, followers ...) is isolated from the rest. Maybe in
    future releases the behaviour of Github component changes to share configuration
    """
